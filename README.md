# ‚è±Ô∏è WatchIt - A personal design and coding challenge

This is the main repository for WatchIt a personal project of mine. As I use timers to track my workouts I thought it would be cool to build some watches inspired by classic watches. This project is currently üöß w.i.p but will be hosted soon. An early version can be found here [watchIt](https://watch-it-ebon.vercel.app/)
The goal is to have multiple watch faces to swipe through including the classic casio, omega seamaster, rolex daytona etc... each supporting individual features. 

## Current State and Process
Currently, one watchface is fully implemented which sets the basis for more to come. I design the watchfaces themselves in figma including the dynamic objects (i.e. second/minute hands etc.). I animate the dynamic objects using css animations. I use the shadcn components for some of my layout.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Tech Stack

This project uses react, next.js and will later be hosted on vercel.
